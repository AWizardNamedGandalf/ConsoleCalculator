//Yes this is the microsoft tutorial
//Yes, it seems you are reading me notes for some reason

#include <iostream>
//oh let me tell you what this does, apparently #include brings in code from other files...
//... in this case it is looking for iostream, whatever that does


using namespace std;
// no std is not a disease in this case, its shorthand for standard
//I think we should not make fun of people with shorthands


int main()
//as in its mainly code
{
	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl;
	//I think cout means character output but idk who knows what << means
	//Oh i actually read stuff and << tells com-pile-er to send whatever is to the right of it to the std!!  
	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | a*b | a/b" << endl;
	//This is in english. I wonder what coding in other languages is like
